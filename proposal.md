# Major Project Proposal

## Description
For the major project I will be creating an Alien Invasion style game. 

## Need To Have List:
- plane that moves, shoots bullets, has hit detection for the aliens and stays inside the canvas
- aliens that come in waves, move to bottom of screen to result in the game being over, 
  has hit boxes that allow them to disappear when hit by a bullet 
- game screens for different situations (start screen, controls, etc.)
- aliens with different amount of health
- aliens will move in a more "exiting" way then just going top to bottom 
- have a wave system where the levels get harder as time goes on 
- a "boss" level 
- decent sound effects
- "upgrades" that fall occasionally with aliens which change things like the type of bullet being shot,
  strength or speed of plane



## Nice To Have List:
