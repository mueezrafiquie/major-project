# Major Project Proposal

## Description
For the major project I will be creating an Alien Invasion style game. 

## Need To Have List:
- plane that moves, shoots bullets, has hit detection for the aliens and stays inside the canvas
- aliens that come in waves, move to bottom of screen to result in the game being over, 
  has hit boxes that allow them to disappear when hit by a bullet 
- game screens for different situations (start screen, controls, etc.)
- aliens with different amount of health
- aliens will move in a more "exiting" way then just going top to bottom 
- have a wave system where the levels get harder as time goes on 
- a "boss" level 
- decent sound effects
- "upgrades" that fall occasionally with aliens which change things like the type of bullet being shot,
  strength or speed of plane
- project that works with different sized screens
- a different type of alien that  can also shoot at the player and also aliens that move toward the player wherever you go




## Nice To Have List:
- nice graphics
- points and upgrade system using some type of "shop" setup where you can redeem points you get by killing aliens for upgrade, 
  having lots of different types of upgrades and ship options which you can start with would be cool
- a "level" screen that shows progress through different level which all have their own types of aliens and unique waves and bosses,
  measuring progress through those levels with a three star system based on how many aliens were let through/amount of damage taken
