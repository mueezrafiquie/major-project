# Major Project Proposal

## Description
For the major project I will be creating an Alien Invasion style game. There wil be a plane that the player moves around while trying to kill the alien invadors. There will be different "power ups" that appear on the screen for the player to collect that change characteristics of the ship and its weaponry and different levels for the player to progress through.

## Need To Have List:
- plane that moves, shoots bullets, has hit detection for the aliens and stays inside the canvas
- aliens that come in waves, move to bottom of screen to result in the game being over, 
  has hit boxes that allow them to disappear when hit by a bullet 
- game screens for different situations (start screen, controls, etc.)
- aliens with different amount of health
- aliens will move in a more "exiting" way then just going top to bottom 
- have a wave system where the levels get harder as time goes on 
- a "boss" level 
- decent sound effects
- a scoring system that tracks highscores and progression
- "upgrades" that fall occasionally with aliens which change things like the type of bullet being shot,
strength or speed of plane
- a different type of alien that  can also shoot at the player and also aliens that move toward the player wherever you go



## Nice To Have List:
- nice graphics
- points and upgrade system using some type of "shop" setup where you can redeem points you get by killing aliens for upgrade, 
  having lots of different types of upgrades and ship options which you can start with would be cool
- different background music for differnt levels and game screens 
- very smooth animations for the alien waves, the bullets and the plane 
- different planes, in addition to already being stronger or weaker, will have their own special ability that maybe has a cooldown
- a "level" screen that shows progress through different level which all have their own types of aliens and unique waves and bosses,
  measuring progress through those levels with a three star system based on how many aliens were let through/amount of damage taken
- different game modes: arcade mode where it's one giant level that keeps going and it tracks how long you last vs a level system
- project that works with different sized screens
